                        <p>
                            Due to fluctuations in weather patterns, the full
                            potential of renewable energy resources in our
                            country is not properly utilised in the power grid.
                            This statement complies with SDG-12
                        </p>
                        <p>
                            Intrahourly fluctuations in wind power generation
                            cause various technical and economic challenges for
                            wind farm integration. With increasing levels of
                            wind energy uptake, managing these fluctuations is
                            likely to require further attention.
